# PreRecordedAir
A piece of software written in Python that lets you air pre-recorded video files!


Hello!

Andrew from Servr Co here. This project was created just for fun, but I figured I would make it open-source.

To use this, you need to have FFMPEG in the same directory as the PreRecordedAir.py file.
Once you have everything set up, run PreRecordedAir and enter the information correctly. Click "Stream!" to go live. If you need to stop the stream, Click Abort.

CONTRIBUTING:
Even though I don't expect anyone to do so, here's how you can help:
1. Fork the project
2. Do your development
3. Issue a Pull Request
4. If nobody has accepted your request within a week, E-Mail us at ServrCoTeam@Gmail.com


Thank you!
